This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Important!

The link provided in the documentation [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu/), did not work for me, because I am not in the EU right now. I had to use [restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com/) instead. Keep this in mind if the API connection does not work for you. You might need to change the link manually.

## Missing features and general improvements

Two things I would have added if I had to work on this project for longer, where TypeScript and Scss. Working with those makes everything much smoother, and I later regretted not installing them to begin with.

Animations could use a bit of work too. I only used them to buy time while the country details loads, but with a bit more time I could have added a stagger to all the different cards I displayed, and make everything transition much better.
